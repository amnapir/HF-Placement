Their work and support will be most valued and reach the desired impact when they are parts of the teams that address the issues directly. That is the only way they can support, act fast and also disseminate knowledge."	"This question again is very hard to answer. It all depends on the organisation and how they are set up. If you have largely homogenic teams, that only interact with each other based on ""need-to"" you will naturally have less HF people within the organisation to support. If you have teams that are from the beginning set up cross-functionally, and the mindest that in certain areas there should be HF experts (with relevant technical background) then it will be a lot easier to hire and place people in the right places."	3	"Some thoughts from experience in several companies and industries, but as a HF expert: The setup of the company will largely dominate the value that is seen in having HF experts supporting different teams. And so does the societal idea of what Human Factors Engineering is. Looking at the job market, there is nowadays a largely different view on the topic than its origin assumes."	"Nowadays especially, when talking HF, many think of a Designer or a UX researcher (which often is assumed is also a designer). Most companies do not see the value of having someone trained in cognitive and ergonomics engineering, and do not see that those people often come with deep technical knowledge that can support the development process in many ways, beyond UI evaluation. If the perception of a HF does not change, and currently it is thoroughly contaminated by UX research and UI design."	"Answering the questions posed here here is thereby rather hard, and I wonder how you will put it into perspective with the different ideas most industries have of the role nowadays."		4	5	5	5	1	5	3	5	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	5	4	5	5	2	9	1014	1023		2023-10-20 10:53:06	T	F	2	2	0	0	1.55
